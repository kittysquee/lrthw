== checks if both sides are equal, if they are then true

!= checks if both sides are equal, if NOT then true

> checks if left operand is greater, if LEFT greater true

< checks if left operand is smaller, if LEFT smaller true

>= checks if left is greater or equal to right. If left greater or same true

<= checks if left side is smaller or equal to right. If left smaller or same true

<=> combined comparison operator
    1 <=> 1 returns 0 (as they are equal)
    1 <=> 0 returns 1 (as first operand is greater than second)
    0 <=> 1 returns -1 (as first operand is smaller than second)

=== used to test equality within a "when" clause of a case statement
    (1...10)===5 returns true
