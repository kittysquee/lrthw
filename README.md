This is a repository for my work from [Zed A. Shaw](https://twitter.com/lzsthw?lang=en-gb)'s book [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). The purpose of this repository is to allow [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) to see my progress with the book and to allow me to practice using Github.
