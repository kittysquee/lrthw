Some string escape sequences have to be carried out within double quotes " "

The backslash escapes these

\\ escapes the backslash, meaning you can put a backslash as "text" within a string

\' will escape a single quote if using within a string contained in single quotes

\" will escape a double quote if using a string contained in double quotes

\a bell - will make the terminal chime when it is ran

\b backspace -will delete a character in the string

\f formfeed - will fracture the string so it will be placed over two lines but the end bit will sit in its position on line one but on line two

\n new line! Only works in double quotes

\r carriage -seems to only put out the string contents after the \r

\t will tab in

\v vertical tab
